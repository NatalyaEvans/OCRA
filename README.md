Files describe the methods and results of the Ocean Carbon Retention under Anoxia (ORCA) research program, led by researchers in the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) NOISE Lab and PI Morgan Reed Raven (Associate Professor, Earth Science Department). Four short research cruises were conducted to Orca Basin in the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. EEZ, in 2023 and 2024. The primary aims of this work were to better understand organic matter cycling in this unusual environment and to evaluate the likely outcomes of potentially sequestering organic carbon at this site as a means of achieving net-negative CO2 removal. 

See the OCRA 1â€“4 Field Report for funding information and disclosures.
